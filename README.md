# Nuxt 3 Minimal Starter

Please take a look at the [Nuxt 3 documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/introduction) to learn more.

## Setup

Using NODE version more than => 16.0.0

Make sure to install the dependencies:
```bash
# npm
npm run install
```
## Development Server

Start the development server on `http://localhost:3000`:

```bash
# npm
npm run dev
```
## URLs query
By default, this will be the main type, but the App has several options:
1) http://localhost:3000/?type=main
2) http://localhost:3000/?type=secondary
3) http://localhost:3000/?type=random (50/50 main/secondary) 

Also, I used different solutions, because it is a test task, so I want to show different solutions.
